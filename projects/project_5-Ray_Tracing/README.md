 ## Usage
     Final version of our raycaster
     
     To use program. compile by running 'make' in the command line:
     
     After it has compiled run "./raycast 'width' 'height' 'input.json' 'output.ppm'"
          - Example: ./raycast 200 150 input.json output.ppm
 
 ## Known Issue
 
  -The team managed to get the reflection to work but for some reason the spheres have very concentrated yellow, teal, and magenta circle on them.
  
  - Along with that, the spotlight functionality does not work as it needs to and discolors many of the shapes.
